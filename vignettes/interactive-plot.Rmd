Interactive graphics can be useful because they make it possible to look at the data in multiple of ways on-the-fly. This is especially important for spatio-temporal data, where we would like to interactively connect spatial and temporal displays. This vignette will show you how to make an interactive graphic with a cubble object. We will be using `crosstalk::bscols()` to create a linked interactive plot of an Australia map, made with leaflet, and a ggplot-turned plotly time series plot: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster-diagram/interactive.png")
```


This vignette assumes you have gone through [Get started](cubble.html) and are familiar with basic data wrangling in cubble with `face_temporal()` and `face_spatial()`. 

# Variation of the diurnal temperature range in Australia

Australia occupies a  and different temperature patterns can be observed. Given the maximum and minimum temperature in the climate data in `climate_subset`, we can compute the average maximum and minimum temperature by month at each location. The difference between the maximum and minimum temperature, the diurnal temperature range, has different variations across the year and its variance will be used as the color for our plot. The codes below compute these variables: 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
climate_smaller <- climate_aus |> slice_sample(n = 30)
(clean <- climate_smaller |>
  face_temporal() |>
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(month) |>
  summarise(
    tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE),
    tmin = mean(tmin, na.rm = TRUE),
    diff = mean(tmax - tmin, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) |>
  face_spatial() |>
  mutate(temp_diff_var = var(ts$diff, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

# Linking with crosstalk

Crosstalk accepts linking between multiple data objects in the same group. Here we create two SharedData objects (one using the nested form and another using the long form), with `id` as the key and give them the same group name (`group = "cubble"`):

```{r}
nested <- clean %>% SharedData$new(~id, group = "cubble")
long <- clean |>
  face_temporal() |>
  unfold(temp_diff_var) |>
  arrange(temp_diff_var) %>% 
  SharedData$new(~id, group = "cubble")
```

# Create maps with leaflet

A basic leaflet map of stations can be created with an underlying map tile (`addTiles()`) and points to represent stations (`addCircleMarkers()`):

```
leaflet(nested, width = 300, height = 300) |>
  addTiles() |>
  addCircleMarkers()
```

Applying color to the stations requires mapping the variable in the data to the color palette. Here the numerical variable `temp_diff_var` is mapped onto a sequential color palette, Rocket, with some fine-tuning using `colorNumeric()`. A popup of station names can be added with the `popup` argument in `addCircleMarkers()` and a `~` is needed when specifying variable name in  leaflet syntax:

```{r}
domain <- clean$temp_diff_var
pal <- colorNumeric(
  colorspace::sequential_hcl(
    "Rocket",  n = 7, cmax = 90, rev = TRUE, c2 = 40, l2= 85, c1 = 20, l1 = 30),
  domain = domain)

map <- leaflet(nested, width = 300, height = 300) |>
  addTiles() |>
  addCircleMarkers(color = ~pal(domain), group = "a", radius = 0.1,
                   popup = ~name, fillOpacity = 1, opacity = 1)
```


# Time series plot with plotly

The time series plot can show the temperature band of each station, allowing for visualising the diurnal temperature range by month. We use `geom_ribbon()` to create a temperature band that shows both the maximum and minimum temperature and add `geom_points()` to allow selection on the plot:

```{r}
ts_static <- long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, group = id,
         fill = temp_diff_var, color = temp_diff_var
         )) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = tmin, ymax = tmax), size = 0.1, alpha = 0.3) +
  # geom_point(aes(y = tmax), size = 0.1) +
  # geom_point(aes(y = tmin), size = 0.1) +
  colorspace::scale_fill_continuous_sequential(
    "Rocket",  n_interp = 7, cmax = 90, rev = TRUE,
    c2 = 40, l2= 85, c1 = 20, l1 = 30, name = "Var. temp. diff.") +
  colorspace::scale_colour_continuous_sequential(
    "Rocket",  n_interp = 7, cmax = 90, rev = TRUE,
    c2 = 40, l2= 85, c1 = 20, l1 = 30, name = "Var. temp. diff.") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Temperature") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom"
    )
```

The static ggplot object can be turned into a plotly object with `ggplotly()` and `plotly::highlight()` enable the selection with box or lasso (`on = "plotly_selected"`):

```{r}
ts_interactive <- ggplotly(ts_static, width = 600, height = 300) %>% 
    highlight(on = "plotly_selected", opacityDim = 0.012)
```


# Assemble into a linked plot

`crosstalk::bscols()` can be thought of as the `patchwork` for interactive graphics, which arranges multiple interactive graphics in columns.

```{r eval = FALSE}
bscols(map, ts_interactive, widths = c(4, 6))
```

Below is a screenshot of the full graphics:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster-diagram/interactive-full.png")
```

# Making selection to see the linking

The selection built in the linked plot goes in both directions. In the screenshot below, a lasso selection is made on the time series and this links to cygnet bay on the northwest coastline of Australia. The area has a larger temperature range in July than in the summer period (December - February).

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster-diagram/selection1.png")
```

Selection on the leaflet map is made through the selection tool below the zoom-in/out bottom on the map. Two selections are made on northern Australia and inland Queensland. Northern Australia has a narrow temperature range constantly 20 degrees throughout the year, while the temperature range in inland Queensland is much larger and there is a clear difference between the summer and winter periods.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster-diagram/selection2.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster-diagram/selection3.png")
```

Now it is your time to view the tooltip on the map and use the selection to explore weather patterns in Australia!
